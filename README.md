# Empowering Green Mobility: Data, Transit, and EV Equity in Georgia

This repository contains the datasets, spatial visualizations, and analysis notebooks from our research on transportation inequity and clean mobility infrastructure across Georgia cities, including Atlanta and Savannah.

## Research Focus

We studied:
- EV charging access and gaps in low-income neighborhoods
- Emissions burdens across Atlanta and Savannah
- Public transit affordability and GTFS mobility patterns
- Spatial intersections of race, income, rent burden, and clean infrastructure

## Folder Breakdown

### `/data`
- Transit agency rates (CSV, XLSX)
- Alternative fuel station locations
- EV charger deployment by region

### `/gtfs`
GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) text files:
- `calendar.txt`, `routes.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, etc.

### `/notebooks`
Jupyter Notebooks used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data:
- `egm_code.ipynb`
- `Atlanta_Savannah.ipynb`

### `/visualizations`
Interactive HTML maps and emissions overlays:
- Atlanta EV equity and transit overlays
- Savannah and Atlanta emissions burden maps

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, geopandas, folium, plotly)
- GTFS data parsing
- HTML map rendering
- Excel + CSV transit data compilation


## About

This project is part of a broader effort to document and understand transportation and environmental injustice through data. Our goal is to use spatial, transit, and emissions data to inform better policy and local planning.
